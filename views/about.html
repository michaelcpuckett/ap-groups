      It's like group chat for <a target="_blank" href="https://joinmastodon.org">Mastodon</a>.

    <p>
      This is an <a target="_blank" href="https://activitypub.rocks">ActivityPub</a> server that can interact with
      any other ActivityPub server, including Mastodon. Every account created here is a Group account, which is a kind of bot for mass communication across servers.
      You can create a Group for anything!

        Any post addressed to a Group by a follower gets reposted
        by the Group, so all followers can see it.
